//! the audio device, opened directly. rodio's sink and mixer handed it one
//! sample at a time, each through a stack of wrappers (a queue, a converter
//! with nothing to convert, pausing, stopping, skipping), and kept it running
//! on silence while nothing played: that walk cost as much as the whole
//! interface thread while music played, and a little for ever after the
//! first offline track, whose stream was never closed. here the device is
//! filled a block at a time and stopped while nothing plays.
